            <p>Southern Leyte, a stunning province in the Philippines, faces significant challenges related to its marine ecosystem. The area has been struggling with illegal fishing practices that threaten its rich biodiversity and disrupt the balance of its underwater habitats. Additionally, an outbreak of Crown-of-Thorns Starfish (COTS) has exacerbated the problem, as these invasive predators damage coral reefs and further strain the local marine environment. Efforts to address these issues are crucial for preserving Southern Leyte‚Äôs unique marine life and ensuring the health of its ecosystems for future generations.</p>
